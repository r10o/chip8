# Chip-8 Emu
## A chip-8 Emulator written in C
### Version 0.0.1

## Introduction
This is my attempt at making a simple chip-8 emulator. This project is purely educational, and is freely available under the MIT License.

## Status
This is currently a work in progress. It does not work at the moment; all you will see is a black screen. Stay tuned for updates.

## How to build
Just run __make__ when you are in the src directory.

## Usage
chip8 [file]
Simple. I might implement some sort of debugger later which could complicate this later.

## What is a "Chip8"?
Check out this wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) for more information.
> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker.
> It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in
> the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made
> to allow video games to be more easily programmed for said computers.
